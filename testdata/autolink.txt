[AutoLink]

Whenever a word (or sequence of words) in the text of a page matches
the title of another page, the system automatically replaces the matching
text with a link to that page. These are called AutoLinks.

Check out "sample page" for example

[sample page about AutoLink]

`table table title contains AutoLink
name, color, AutoLink
AutoLink, AutoLink, AutoLink
`b(AutoLink), blue, and bold
`/

Go to the AutoLink page for context. In short, every time the word
"AutoLink" is present on this page, it should be underlined and link
to the "AutoLink" page.

Even if it's part of a table, or formatted like e.g. bold `b(AutoLink) or italics `em(AutoLink)
